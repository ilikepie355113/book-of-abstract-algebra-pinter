# book-of-abstract-algebra-pinter

In an effort to not forget all the math (and LaTeX) I leanred while getting a degree,
I decided to review Charles Pinter's book on Abstract Algebra. Unfortunately there is no sultions manual 
(my biggest gripe about text books for self learning. How are you supposed to learn if you
don't know if you are correct or not??). So I figured I'd put all the answers online.
Hopefully all of what I write will be correct, but if for some reason you found your way here
and have found an error, please fix it!
